Very basic hack looking at moving repositories from one Azure devops to another in an automated fashion.

Running: 

1. Clone
2. Open in VSCode devcontainer
3. Copy `example.env` -> `.env` and fill out details of source (proj1/org1/pat1) and dest (proj2/org2/pat2)
4. Press F5 to start

This is untested - don't use without reviewing the code and giving least privilidge
